# Datapack Docs
This is meant for those who might be new, or just want to check out the docs in case there is something they don't know.
*However*, there is a advanced documentation **coming soon!**

## What does this cover?

**As of now,** nothing!
I'm still working on this, and it might take a while until my dreams for this documentation will become a reality.

## Roadmap 2023 - Beginning of 2024

I'm planning to add a majority of the basics by the end of 2023. This includes making a datapack *(And supplying one for those who are lazy)*, making a resource
pack *(Also supplying a base pack for those who are lazy)*, the different generators that will make it easier to code it, and the basics of the following:

Floor Crafting *(Pretty self explantory)*

Custom Items *(With custom textures)*

Custom Crafting *(With the knowledge book method)*

Custom Armor *(Also shows the optifine CIT method for those who wish to add custom models)*

Custom Enchantments *(Also self explanatory)*

How to make 3D models and import them *(With custom model data OR just replacing textures)*

Custom GUIs *(With textures that resemble the real GUIs or using stained glass panes to fill the empty spaces)*

Custom Arrows *(With custom textures)*

Raycasts *(Lasers and such)*

**These might not be commited in order, but they will be in order in the actual website**
